# DHCP Client Simulator (Raw Sockets, No Scapy)

This project simulates **multiple DHCP clients** in parallel using raw sockets, without relying on Scapy or external libraries. It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 protocols.

* DHCPv4: Full DHCP handshake (DISCOVER ‚Üí OFFER ‚Üí REQUEST ‚Üí ACK) and lease release
* DHCPv6: Full prefix delegation (SOLICIT ‚Üí ADVERTISE ‚Üí REQUEST ‚Üí REPLY) and release

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable number of clients and concurrency
- üöÄ Pure Python, no third-party dependencies
- üîÅ Full DHCP exchange per client
- üìâ Summary statistics after run
- üßπ Sends DHCPRELEASE on Ctrl+C or normal exit
- ‚úÖ Works well on Linux or macOS with elevated privileges
- üåê Supports both IPv4 and IPv6

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Root privileges (to bind to privileged ports and send broadcasts)
- Linux or macOS (tested on both)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for container setup)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```bash
# Standalone DHCPv4 usage
sudo python3 client/dhcp_simulator.py

# Standalone DHCPv6 usage
sudo python3 client/dhcpv6_simulator.py

# Or with Docker (runs both IPv4 and IPv6)
docker-compose up

# To run only IPv4 services
docker-compose up dhcp-server dhcp-client

# To run only IPv6 services
docker-compose up dhcpv6-server dhcpv6-client

# ==== CONFIG ====
# Edit client/dhcp_simulator.py to configure DHCPv4:
TOTAL_CLIENTS = 50         # Number of DHCP clients to simulate
MAX_CONCURRENT = 10        # Maximum concurrent clients
LEASE_DURATION = 30        # Hold leases for N seconds before releasing
INTERFACE = 'eth0'         # Interface (eth0 in Docker, may be different on host)

# Edit client/dhcpv6_simulator.py to configure DHCPv6:
TOTAL_CLIENTS = 50         # Number of DHCPv6 clients to simulate
MAX_CONCURRENT = 10        # Maximum concurrent clients
LEASE_DURATION = 30        # Hold leases for N seconds before releasing
INTERFACE = 'eth0'         # Interface (eth0 in Docker, may be different on host)
